> Codex adaptation:
> - Source: `.agent/skills/database-design/SKILL.md`
> - Treat references to Antigravity agents as Codex skills with the same names in this package.
> - When the source says to invoke or hand off to another agent, apply that skill's guidance directly instead of expecting a native subagent feature.
> - Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` only for independent tool calls that can safely run at the same time.
> - Paths to mirrored skills were rewritten from `.agent/skills/...` to `.codex/skills/...` where applicable.

# Database Design

> **Learn to THINK, not copy SQL patterns.**

## [target] Selective Reading Rule

**Read ONLY files relevant to the request!** Check the content map, find what you need.

| File | Description | When to Read |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `database-selection.md` | PostgreSQL vs Neon vs Turso vs SQLite | Choosing database |
| `orm-selection.md` | Drizzle vs Prisma vs Kysely | Choosing ORM |
| `schema-design.md` | Normalization, PKs, relationships | Designing schema |
| `indexing.md` | Index types, composite indexes | Performance tuning |
| `optimization.md` | N+1, EXPLAIN ANALYZE | Query optimization |
| `migrations.md` | Safe migrations, serverless DBs | Schema changes |

## [!] Core Principle

- ASK user for database preferences when unclear
- Choose database/ORM based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to PostgreSQL for everything

---

## Decision Checklist

Before designing schema:

- [ ] Asked user about database preference?
- [ ] Chosen database for THIS context?
- [ ] Considered deployment environment?
- [ ] Planned index strategy?
- [ ] Defined relationship types?

---

## Anti-Patterns

[x] Default to PostgreSQL for simple apps (SQLite may suffice)
[x] Skip indexing
[x] Use SELECT * in production
[x] Store JSON when structured data is better
[x] Ignore N+1 queries
