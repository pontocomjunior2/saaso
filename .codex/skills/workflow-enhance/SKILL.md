name: "workflow-enhance"
description: "Antigravity workflow adapted for Codex. Add or update features in existing application. Used for iterative development. Use when the user explicitly asks for the enhance workflow or when the current task matches that flow."

> Codex adaptation:
> - Source: `.agent/workflows/enhance.md`
> - Treat references to Antigravity agents as Codex skills with the same names in this package.
> - When the source says to invoke or hand off to another agent, apply that skill's guidance directly instead of expecting a native subagent feature.
> - Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` only for independent tool calls that can safely run at the same time.
> - Treat slash-command examples as explicit skill usage patterns, not as literal runtime commands.
